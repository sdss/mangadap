class Vander1D:

    Base class for least-squares fitting using linear combinations of 1D
    basis functions.

    Args:
        vander (callable):
            Function used to generate the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix
            of the basis functions; e.g.,
            `numpy.polynomial.legendre.legvander`_. Calling sequence
            must be ``vander(x,order)``.
        x (array-like):

            Order of the fit.

            Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values
            smaller than this relative to the largest singular value
            will be ignored. The default value is len(x)*eps, where eps
            is the relative precision of the float type, about 2e-16 in
            most cases.

    Attributes:

        rcond (:obj:`float`):

        Fit the provided data.

        The ordinate is provided on the class instantiation.

        If provided, the errors, :math:`\epsilon`, are converted to
        weights to use during the fitting, where :math:`\omega_i =
        1/\epsilon_i`. Both weights, :math:`w`, and errors can be
        provided; however, in this case, the weights used during the
        fit are are :math:`\omega_i = w_i / \epsilon_i`.

        .. todo::
            
            Allow for the nominal calculation of the errors in the
            coefficients.

        Args:
            y (array-like):
                A 1D or 2D array with the 1D functions to fit. Shape
                is :math:`(N_x,)` or :math:`(N_{\rm vec},N_x)`, where
                :math:`N_x` is the length of the ordinate
                (:attr:`x`). Input can be a masked array.
            w (array-like, optional):
                A 1D or 2D array with the weights for each pixel.
                Shape is :math:`(N_x,)` or :math:`(N_{\rm vec},N_x)`,
                where :math:`N_x` is the length of the ordinate
                (:attr:`x`). If ``w`` is 1D, but ``y`` is 2D, the
                same weights are applied to all vectors.
            err (array-like, optional):
                Error in ``y``, used for weighting. Shape must match
                ``y``.
            mask (array-like, optional):
                A boolean mask; values to ignore should have ``mask
                == True``. Shape must match ``y``. Treated
                identically as a mask provided by passing in a
                `numpy.ma.MaskedArray`_ for ``y``. Note that
                providing a weight of 0 is identical to masking the
                value.
            rej_iter (:obj:`int`, optional):
                Number of fit rejection iterations.  If 0, no rejection
                iterations are performed.  If -1, rejections are
                performed until no points are rejected in a given
                iteration.
            rej_lo (scalar-like, optional):
                The lower sigma rejection threshold.
            rej_hi (scalar-like, optional):
                The higher sigma rejection threshold.
            rej_win (:obj:`int`, optional):
                The length of a boxcar window to use in a calculation of
                a *local* standard deviation used during the rejection
                iterations.  This is useful if the S/N varies strongly
                within the provided vector being fit.  If None, no
                windowing is applied, meaning a *global* standard
                deviation is used for rejection.
            model (:obj:`bool`, optional):
                If True, return the model as well as the best fitting
                coefficients.

        Returns:
            `numpy.ndarray`, :obj:`tuple`: As many as three objects
            can be returned. Regardless of the input, the function
            always returns an array with the best-fitting
            coefficients, with shape :math:`(o+1,)` or :math:`(N_{\rm
            vec},o+1)`, depending on the input shape of ``y``. If
            ``model`` is True, an array with the best-fitting models
            are also returned (same shape as ``y``). If rejection
            operations are performed, a boolean array flagging the
            pixels excluded from the fit is also returned. Note that
            any data that will have been ignored based on the input
            (the element is masked or has 0 weight) is *not* flagged
            as having been rejected.
