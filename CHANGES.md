2.2.3dev
--------
 - Put in default paths when environmental variables not defined and
   warn user, both when running setup.py and when importing mangadap

TODO:
 - Documentation of config examples are out of date!
 - Get rid of the filter keyword from the output headers...
 - Change default to fix bad pixels in spectral resolution?
 - Fix MASKNAME in reference files
 - Add DAP versioning to reference files
 - Fix ELMREBIN in 2nd round of moment calculations

2.2.2 (Not released):
---------------------
 - Code migrated from SVN to GitHub

2.2.1 (28 Mar 2018): MPL-7/DR15 Candidate tag
---------------------------------------------
 - Add DAPFRMT and DAPTYPE header keywords to MAPS and LOGCUBE files.

2.2   (23 Mar 2018): Initial tag for DR15
-----------------------------------------
 - Fixed NaN problems in DAPall file
 - Emission-lines moments are remeasured after the emission-line model
   fitting to account for the adjustments made to the continuum during
   that process.
 - During the emission-line modeling, fit metrics are now computed in
   15-pixel wide windows around each fitted line.  The metrics are
   amplitude, amplitude-to-noise, chi-square, root-mean-square
   difference with the model, and fractional RMS wrt the model.  These
   data are currently only in the reference files, not the output maps.
 - Begun coding for switching the templates between what is used for the
   stellar kinematics fitting and what's used for the emission-line
   modeling.  Coding incomplete, but does not effect runs that use the
   same template sets for both analysis steps (as done in DR15).
 - MILES-HC templates changed to reflect re-run of the analysis by M.
   Cappellari so that we have documented which MILES template is
   incorporated into each MILES-HC template.  The total number of
   templates was again 49; however, 7 of these have been removed because
   they had artifacts and/or emission-lines in their spectra.  See
   ./data/spectral_templates/miles_cluster/README .
 - Included redshift fix file that can be used to replace the redshift
   used for any PLATEIFU either because it's not provided by the
   relevant ancillary programs or the NSA redshift is incorrect.
 - Corrected error in the emission-line fluxes for the fact that the
   input template flux increases with the fitted redshift.  So: F_true =
   (1+z)*F_MPL6.
 - Corrected the emission-line equivalent width measurements from
   observed to rest frame.
 - Corrected the absorption-line spectral-index equivalent widths
   (angstrom units) from observed to rest frame.
 - Emission-line moments and spectral-indices (anything depending on the
   integration over a set of bandpasses) are now flagged as UNRELIABLE
   in the output maps if *any* pixels are masked in *any* their
   respective band passes.  This is true for both the main passband and
   any sidebands.
 - Spectral index measurements are now provided for the HYB binning
   scheme.
 - Spectral-index velocity-dispersion corrections are done adopting the
   NSA redshift for all spectra.  This means that there will be a
   *velocity* dependence of the correction that can be more significant
   that the correction for the velocity dispersion itself.  The approach
   to the velocity dispersion corrections should be improved in future
   releases.
    
2.1.3 (21 Nov 2017)
-------------------
 - Minor bug fix

2.1.2 (21 Nov 2017)
-------------------
 - Calculation of binned flux statistics now uses response function
   provided to the ReductionAssessments class
 - Binned flux statistics now determined before applying the reddening
   correction; now matches individual spaxel measurements.
 - Fixed some roundoff errors in the SPX_* extensions due to conversion
   from double to single-precision floats in output MAPS
 - Removed resolution-vector-based stellar velocity dispersion
   corrections from output MAPS files.  Only empirical (more robust)
   correction now provided, but resolution-vector calculation still in
   reference files.
 - Propagated this change though to the ppxf and spotcheck qa plots
 - Added EMLINE_TPLSIGMA to output MAPS files, providing the line width
   of the templates used during Sasuke.  Also added this into the
   measurements returned by pPXF such that EMLINE_GSIGMA and
   EMLINE_INSTSIGMA have the same meaning as in MPL-5: EMLINE_GSIGMA is
   the effective observed sigma of the line and EMLINE_INSTSIGMA is the
   instrumental dispersion at the line centroid.

2.1.1 (13 Nov 2017)
-------------------

 - Added check that pPXF returns some non-zero weights in
   stellar-continuum fitting.  If all weights are zero, the pPXF status
   is set to -2.
 - Check if all stellar-continuum fits are bad.  If so, emission-line
   model set fixed stellar kinematics to input redshift and dispersion =
   100 km/s, and the DAP quality flag set to CRITICAL.
 - Fixed fitting window determination in Sasuke
 - Allow for fit to proceed if input velocity is > -500 km/s (previously
   > 0 km/s).
 - Dummy indices are flagged as NOVALUE in output MAPS file
 - Any IVAR values that are 0 in 
 - Changed QA plotting scripts to account for bug in numpy/matplotlib

2.1   (27 Oct 2017)
-------------------

 - Included code for DAPall file
 - Fixed error in bin area calculation in unbinned data.
 - Added convenience functions to DAPFits for use with the MAPS files.
 - Fixed problem with velocity offset between template and galaxy data
   due to difference in pixel sampling.
 - Updated mangampl.py to include matplotlib version; added MPL-6
   versions
 - Fixed how the stellar-continuum-fitting masks are saved; still need
   to make sure users can reconstruct these exactly from the output
   model cube files.
 - Changed how spectral step is calculated to avoid numerical precision
   issues.
 - Incorporated M. Cappellari's gaussian_filter1d into the
   convolution_variable_sigma function in
   python/mangadap/util/instrument.py.  It's 2 orders of magnitude
   faster now!
 - Include spectral resolution handling hooks into spatial binning and
   stellar continuum fitting.  The code is compliant with data that both
   does and does not have the 'DISP' extension in the DRP cube file for
   backwards compatibility.
 - "Database" parameter classes (e.g., EmissionLineDB) have been moved
   from python/mangadap/par to python/mangadap/proc/.
 - Incorporated spaxel-by-spaxel instrumental dispersion corrections.
 - Significantly restructuring of most of the core classes to minimize
   the size of the reference files and to use common functions where
   possible (e.g., new DAPFitsUtil class).
 - Added equivalent width measurements for the Gaussian fitted fluxes;
   core function identical for the summed and Gaussian-fit fluxes.
 - Moved construction of main output files to dapfits.py
 - Include a map mask in reference files
 - Allow rundap to read the plate, ifu, and mode combinations to analyze
   from a file
 - Include filtering approach in stellar kinematics fitting
 - Incorporate ppxf v6.0.6
 - Reading/writing of fits data is now done using DAPFitsUtil.  When
   reading with this utility, the fits image data are automatically
   restructured into a row-major ordering to ease the confusion between
   the way astropy.io.fits provides the data and the ordering of the
   NAXIS keywords.  At the moment, this restructuring does not mess up
   the WCS coordinates in the header; however, depending on any
   development of astropy.io.fits in the future, this may become a
   problem.  This feels like a big mess at the moment, but there's no
   easy way around it.
 - Restructured how the covariance data are read and written to adhere
   to the format already adopted by the DRP.  The Covariance class
   should now be able to seemlessly read the broad-band correlation
   matrices provided in the LOGCUBE files.
 - Added DefaultConfig class to help manage config files.  Edited the
   StellarContinuumModelDef parameters to accommodate the new filtering
   approach.  Removed all but one StellarContinuumModel method.
 - Include an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion correction
   based on fitting the native resolution optimized template to the same
   spectrum that has been rsolution matched to object spectrum being
   fit.
 - Changed velocity dispersion correction calculation for stellar
   kinematics: Old version used mean resolution difference between
   galaxy and template spectra.  New version uses a fit of the
   best-fitting model template to a resolution-matched version of
   itself. 
 - MAPS and LOGCUBE files set to single-precision float for survey
   output.
 - BINID in MAPS and LOGCUBE files set to int32 type for survey output.
 - Added NeIII and higher-order Balmer series lines (up to H10).
 - General improvements to the documentation
 - New emission-line module Sasuke that uses pPXF to fit the lines.
 - Adjusted pPXF filtering approach: remove final, fixed-kinematics fit
   and set polynomial order of initial fit to be the effective order of
   the filter (full length/smoothing box-1)
 - Calculate and include nominal errors in template weights in output
   reference file for stellar continuum model.
 - HARDCODED: Use first moment of H-alpha as the initial velocity guess
   for the emission lines.
 - Include pre-pixelized Gaussian extension from DRP.
 - Use 'z' column in plateTargets files to construct input parameter
   files instead of the 'nsa_z' column; this should catch the
   ancillaries not in the NSA but with redshifts in the targeting
   catalog.
 - In rundap, wait for cluster processes to finish then also submit a
   script to construct the DAPall file
 - Updated versions of ppxf and voronoi_2d_binning and moved these files
   out of the mangadap package and into a new captools directory
 - Edited Sasuke to use iterations tested by Xihan Ji and Michele
   Cappellari.

2.0.2 (04 Aug 2016)
-------------------
 - Bug in setup for emission-line and spectral-index measurements when
   stellar continuum not fit.
 - Fixed error in return type when an emission-line fit fails, and
   report which line and spectrum failed.
 - Necessary conversions from asarray() to atleast_1d()
 - Include spot-check plotting code for maps
 - NEARBOUND is treated differently and separately applied to the
   stellar velocities and stellar velocity dispersions.  pPXF fits where
   the velocity dispersions at the lower bound do not *necessarily* have
   a bad velocity measurement.
 - Minor adjustments to TemplateLibrary and DRPComplete classes
 - Added python versions to mangampl.py and version checking to
   rundap.py; strict version compliance can be ignored if necessary
 - Added version information to dapcube.py and dapmaps.py
 - Corrected HDUCLAS2 for some MAPS extensions

2.0.1 (26 Jul 2016)
-------------------

 - Removed old DAP IDL code, except for pro/mangadap_version.pro
 - Included correction for Galactic extinction; current default is to
   use the O'Donnell (1994) coefficents for the CCM extinction law.
 - Added MILES cluster template group.
 - Allow for choice to *not* match the spectral resolution of the
   template to that of the galaxy data, and supply templates at higher
   spectral sampling.
 - Include stellar velocity dispersion quadrature correction.
 - Included v6.0.0 of pPXF; allows analytic calculation of LOSVD FFT for
   better performance at low velocity dispersion
 - Fixed error in spectral-index masks
 - Dispersion correction separated from spectral-index measurements in
   maps file
 - Spectral-index dispersion corrections not automatically applied
 - Added config to ignore resolution matching in spectral-index
   measurements (for testing)
 - Changed the lower limit of the emission-line dispersion to be 30
   km/s, which means the line has a FWHM ~1 pixel at minimum; upper
   bound changed to 800 km/s.
 - Definition of "near" bounds for bounded kinematic fits:
     - Velocities and higher moments: Cannot be nearer to a bound than
       1% of the full width of the allowed parameter space.
     - Velocity dispersions: Cannot be nearer to a bound than 1% of the
       LOG of the full width of the allowed parameter space.  The
       velocity limits for the emission-lines are dynamically defined by
       the lines in the window or to be +/- 25 angstroms about the line
       center, and no higher moments are fit at the moment.  So the only
       fixed limits are for the dispersion; any values within the ranges
       30.:31, 774.16:800 are considered "near" the boundary.
     - For the stellar kinematics, this means:

       | PAR   |     NEAR_BOUND ranges   |
       |:-----:| -----------------------:|
       |    V  | -2000:-1960, 1960:2000  |
       | sigma | 6.903:7.255, 951.46:1e3 |
       |  hN   | -0.3:-0.294, 0.294:0.3  |

 - Stellar-continuum model mask now includes NEAR_BOUND bits, if
   necessary.
 - Constructs an output model data cube with the stellar continuum and
   emission-line model as a complement to the maps file.
 - Allows for an iteration that modifies the stellar-continuum fit by
   unmasking and fitting the emission lines, while not changing the
   stellar kinematics.
 - Fixed problem with emission-line parameters returned for non-primary
   lines fit in each window.
 - Fixed error in construction of the Hessian (inverse covariance)
   matrix from the emission-line fits.
 - Removed SPXL_SPCOV extension; changed extension names from 'SPXL' to
   'SPX' to match binning scheme name.
 - Bookkeeping error in emission-line moment measurements
 - Incorrect/incomplete checking for sufficient data to fit emission
   lines

2.0   (08 Jun 2016)
-------------------
 -  Initial tag after major refactor of DAP to be solely in python.
    Some directory cleanup performed; however, the pro/ directory is
    still included in this tag.  All further tags will have the pro/
    directory removed.
 -  This tag was used to run initial benchmark tests for the candidate
    MPL-5 data.

1.1.2 (24 Feb 2016)
-------------------
 - Tag stable version of trunk before starting major revisions to python
   directory for MPL-5.

1.1.1 (25 Jan 2016)
-------------------
 - Tagged version run for MPL-4.
 - Tag was created much later than MPL-4 was released.  DAP MPL-4
   release located in the mangawork/sandbox directory, and not
   maintained in the nominal MANGA_SPECTRO_ANALYSIS directory structure
   because run on ICG, Portsmouth, cluster.  Differences between tagged
   version and version that produced MPL-4 are minor and largely
   contained within the python/mangadap/plot directory.  Edits to
   plotting routines have been used for plots of MPL-4 data shown in
   Marvin.
