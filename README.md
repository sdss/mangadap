The MaNGA data-analysis pipeline (MaNGA DAP) is the survey-led software package
that has analyzed all galaxy data produced by the MaNGA data-reduction pipeline
(MaNGA DRP).  Its goal is to produce high-level, science-ready data products
derived from MaNGA spectra.  The products currently provided are:

 - Spatially stacked spectra
 - Stellar kinematics
 - Nebular emission-line properties: fluxes, equivalent widths, and
   kinematics
 - Spectral indices: absorption-line (e.g., H-delta) and bandhead/color
   (e.g., TiO, D4000) measurements

That is, the DAP currently focuses on "model-independent" properties.
Higher-level, model-dependent properties, such as stellar-population parameters,
are outside of the scope of the current pipeline.

## SDSS Data Release Versions

 - [SDSS-IV/MaNGA DR15](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/) is based on version 2.2.1

 - [SDSS-IV/MaNGA DR17](https://www.sdss.org/dr17/manga/) is based on version
   3.1.2.  Note that the version of the code that produced the DR17 was version
   3.1.0; version 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 only include documentation updates.
